            <h2> Healthy Eating Plan </h2>
            <p> A healthy eating plan gives your body the nutrients it needs every day while staying within your daily calorie goal for weight loss.
                A healthy eating plan also will lower your risk for heart disease and other health conditions.</p>

               
            <h2> Calories </h2>   
            <p> To lose weight, most people need to reduce the number of calories they get from food and beverages (energy IN) and
                increase their physical activity (energy OUT).For a weight loss of 1–1 ½ pounds per week,
                daily intake should be reduced by 500 to 750 calories. Eating plans that contain 1,200–1,500 calories each day will
                help most women lose weight safely. Very low calorie diets of fewer than 800 calories per day should not be used 
                unless you are being monitored by your doctor. </p>

            <h2> Fat Loss Workouts </h2>
            <p> When you skip a workout what’s the number one excuse? More than likely it’s time. 
                Hitting the gym for an hour five days a week plus commuting time is a real commitment. 
                If you miss a leg day then it’s almost two weeks before you hit that muscle group again. 
                Not ideal for muscular development or fat loss.</p>

            <h2> Muscle & Strength’s 10 Week Women’s Fat Loss Workout </h2> 
            <p> However, there’s a lot of misinformation out there on how women should diet and work out to achieve this goal.
                Most women’s magazines will tell you that some fad diet, some basic ab & glute workout circuit, or even tons of cardio is the solution.
                The truth is, these things can work (when part of a larger, complete plan) – but there’s nothing special about them and
                they can make your fat loss journey a lot more difficult than it has to be.In reality, hard work with some resistance training balanced
                with some additional cardio to ramp up your daily calorie expenditure is the best approach. And when paired with a diet that puts you in 
                a slight calorie deficit, will help you shed any unwanted body fat you may have.</p>
